This is the stream-aquifer interaction example problem (test 1) from the Streamflow Routing Package documentation (Prudic and others, 1989).  The specified depth segments in the original problem have been converted to active reaches and the diversion has been converted from UPTO to FRACTION CPRIOR type. This problem is simulated using the Streamflow Routing (SFR) Package in MODFLOW 6.
